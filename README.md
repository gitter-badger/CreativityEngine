# Creativity Game Engine
Creativity Engine is a Game Engine being developed from scratch using C++ and SDL2. The Goals are to create a game engine with 3D functionality, an editor, and mayble some actual games.

It only supports building to Desktop platforms for now, but maybe Android and iOS build support may be implemented.

This repository contains the main engine source code and uses only SDL2.
